                            <h3>The devastating truth about the effects of wheat, sugar, and carbs on the brain, with a
                                4-week plan to
                                achieve optimum
                                health. </h3>
                            <p>In Grain Brain, renowned neurologist David Perlmutter, MD, exposes a finding that's been
                                buried in the
                                medical
                                literature for far too long: carbs are destroying your brain. Even so-called healthy
                                carbs
                                like whole
                                grains can cause
                                dementia, ADHD, epilepsy, anxiety, chronic headaches, depression, decreased libido, and
                                much
                                more.</p>

                            <p>Groundbreaking and timely, Grain Brain shows that the fate of your brain is not in your
                                genes. It's in
                                the food you eat.
                                The cornerstone of all degenerative conditions, including brain disorders, is
                                inflammation,
                                which can be
                                triggered by
                                carbs, especially containing gluten or high in sugar. Dr. Perlmutter explains what
                                happens
                                when the
                                brain encounters
                                common ingredients in your daily bread and fruit bowls, how statin drugs may be erasing
                                your
                                memory, why
                                a diet high in
                                "good fats" is ideal, and how to spur the growth of new brain cells at any age.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Perlmutter's revolutionary 4-week plan shows you how to keep your brain healthy,

                                everyday
